//! Completed frames and the buffer pool they draw from.
//!
//! [`FramePool`] is a flume channel of preallocated slots — the channel *is*
//! the lock-free free list. A slot travels: pool → stream worker (filling) →
//! [`Frame`] (delivered as `Arc<Frame>`) → back to the pool when the last
//! `Arc` drops. A slow consumer holding frames therefore degrades into pool
//! underruns at the worker, never blocking it.
